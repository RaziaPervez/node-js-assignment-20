//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of 
//mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
//making array of mountains name
var mountainNames = ["k2", "mount everest", "himalayan", "karakoram"];
//printing the message list
console.log("list of mountain name");
//print the array in the form of list
mountainNames.forEach(function (mountain) { return console.log(mountain); });
